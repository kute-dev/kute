// Package resources: 0.8.0 plan Phase 5's neutral CronJob action/preflight
// data helpers — the pure computations behind §36b's run-now overlap card
// and §36c's suspend/resume previews. Kept separate from cronjobs.go
// (Phase 1's aggregation/projection) because these are read by a staged
// *action*, not a table row: browse's jobs.go/cronjob_actions.go calls them
// today, and Phase 7's cronjobdetail (which needs the identical run-now/
// suspend/resume previews on its own facts grid) will call the same
// functions once it exists — task packages can't import one another, so
// this shared logic lives here instead of in either task package. Every
// function is pure: caller-supplied `now`, no cluster I/O, no clock reads.
