//
// Start reads stopCh to hand it to the health loop and to the cache-sync wait,
// and both of those reads used to happen after Start had released c.mu — while
// every writer of the field (Stop, SwitchContext) holds it. That is a plain
// data race, and the failure past the race detector is worse than a torn read:
// Stop's "this cluster is dead" sentinel is a *nil* stopCh, so losing the race
// handed startHealthLoop a nil channel and panicked the process on the first
// ping, and handed cache.WaitForCacheSync a nil stop channel it never returns
// from.
//
// Fresh cluster per iteration because Start latches c.started and Stop does not
// clear it — a loop over one cluster would only ever exercise the first Start.

// context, so handing it the cluster's own stopCh left this goroutine blocked
// until the whole cluster was torn down — the normal path whenever
// SwitchContext's or attemptReconnect's timeout expires against a slow cluster.
//
// The synctest bubble is what makes the assertion exact rather than a goroutine
// census: it does not finish while a goroutine started inside it is still
// running, so a stranded waiter fails the test by construction rather than by
// timing. Restore the pre-fix `WaitForCacheSync(stopCh, ...)` and this test
// hangs the bubble instead of passing.
