// This file is the reason the suite runs on kind rather than kwok. A fake
// kubelet can serve a pod list; only a real one can hand back a shell probe's
// exit status or carry bytes through a port-forward. Logs (§5b) are covered in
// flow_test.go; these are the other two.

// TestExecPickerDetectsShellsOnARealContainer covers §10a as far as a headless
// harness honestly can. The picker itself is fully exercisable: it opens
// because the api pod has two containers (a single-container pod execs
// straight through without it), and its shells column comes from a real
// exec round-trip against the running container — not from anything the
// object says about itself.
//
// It deliberately stops short of ↵. That hands the tty to kubectl via
// tea.ExecProcess, and there is no tty here to hand over; the fixture's job
// is to prove the probe and the picker work against a real kubelet.
