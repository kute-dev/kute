// jobattempts screen's own 'R' (§37b/§37c) both need identical answers,
// and task packages can't import one another. Every function is pure:
// caller-supplied `now` where relevant, no cluster I/O, no clock reads.
//
// kube.NextRerunName (internal/kube/cronjob_naming.go) is §37c's name
// generator — it lives in kube, not here, because it shares dnsSafeTruncate
// with ManualJobName and needs no JobAttemptsSummary/Row awareness at all;
// this file only holds the two functions that actually read attempt data.
