// KindSyncChecker is implemented by a lister whose per-kind caches populate
// asynchronously (*kube.Cluster's informers, which start on first read).
// Mirrors browse.KindSyncChecker; declared here too so task packages that
// don't import browse can gate on it. namespace is the exact namespace the
// caller's own read used — cluster-wide mode always normalizes to the same
// answer regardless of what's passed, but namespace-scoped mode keys each
// cache by namespace, so asking about the wrong one answers for a cache that
// was never read (docs/lazy-informers.md §5.6: "ask about
// the same namespace the read used").

// cluster has none of this kind. Screens that gate an empty state on
// KindsSynced ask this next, and show the failure instead.
//

// than kind-by-kind: with one kind forbidden and another merely stalling, the
