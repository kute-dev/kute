// auxKinds maps a listed kind to the other kinds its rows and prompts read.
// A list is rarely built from one cache: the Deployments IMAGE column
// compares against ReplicaSets, the Ingresses BACKENDS column resolves
// through Services and Pods, the Pods health strip counts Nodes, and the
// scale prompt looks for a managing HorizontalPodAutoscaler.
//
// Two things use this. Reloading: a change to any of these kinds changes
// what the current list should show, and browse subscribed only to the kind
// it was displaying — so a Deployment's image cell went stale on a rollout
// until something else prompted a reload. Prefetching: informers start on
// first read, and several of these are read synchronously from a keypress
// handler with nowhere to put a loading state, so the first press would
// otherwise get an empty cache and quietly render a wrong-but-plausible
// answer ("no rollout history", "no HPA manages this").

// cluster-wide Secret cache (12.3 MB on the cluster this was measured
// against) on the way into a screen that never reads it — reinstating, as a
