#Requires -Version 5.1
<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Installs kute, a TUI Kubernetes console.

.DESCRIPTION
    The Windows counterpart to https://kute.dev/install.sh. Downloads the
    release archive for this machine's architecture, verifies its cosign
    signature when cosign is installed, verifies it against the release's
    checksums.txt, and installs kute.exe.

        irm https://kute.dev/install.ps1 | iex

    Environment overrides, matching install.sh:
        $env:KUTE_VERSION       release to install (default: latest)
        $env:KUTE_INSTALL_DIR   install location
                                (default: %LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\kute)
#>

$ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop'
# Windows PowerShell 5.1 renders a progress bar for every Invoke-WebRequest
# and it costs roughly an order of magnitude in download time.
$ProgressPreference = 'SilentlyContinue'

# The checksum verified below proves the archive matches a manifest that came
# down the same wire as the archive; only the signature says the release is
# ours. cosign is not a dependency of this script, so a machine without it
# gets a note and the checksum — a stronger check that nobody can run is not
# stronger. Same for a release predating signing: don't fail an install that
# used to work.
