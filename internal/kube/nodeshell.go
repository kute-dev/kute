// a privileged container in the node's host namespaces, chrooted into the
// node's root filesystem. Two managed platforms make that impossible, and
// they fail in ways worth telling apart from "the command didn't work":
//
//   - EKS Fargate. Each pod gets its own synthetic Node object with no
//     machine behind it to attach to.
//   - GKE Autopilot. The nodes are real, but Autopilot's admission webhooks
//     reject privileged host-namespace containers outright.
//
// Neither is detectable from a cluster-level API — Autopilot in particular is
// a property of the GKE cluster resource, not of anything Kubernetes serves —
// so this reads the node's own labels, falling back to GKE's Autopilot node
// naming for the case where no label distinguishes it. Deliberately
// conservative: a false negative just means the user sees kubectl's own
// rejection instead of ours, while a false positive would hide a working
// verb, so the name check only applies to nodes already known to be GKE's.
//
// This is a message, not a gate: docs/managed-clusters.md §3 asks for "a
// clear error naming the reason, not a hidden key", so 'x' stays on a
// Node's keybar and explains itself when pressed (the debug panel it opens
// — tasks/debugpanel, §41d — never launches).
