// Exec credential plugins (gke-gcloud-auth-plugin, `aws eks get-token`,
// kubelogin) are the credential shape kute meets on GKE and EKS, and the
// first one that is re-minted *during* a session rather than read once from
// the kubeconfig: a GKE token lasts about an hour, an EKS one about fifteen
// minutes. client-go re-runs the plugin binary when the current credential
// expires, from whichever goroutine happens to make the next request — an
// informer's watch, the /livez ping — at an arbitrary point hours after
// launch.
//
// That subprocess and kute are then fighting over one terminal, on both ends:
//
//   - stdin. A v1beta1 exec block with no interactiveMode defaults to
//     IfAvailable "for backwards compatibility"
//     (tools/clientcmd/api/v1/defaults.go), which is exactly what `aws eks
//     update-kubeconfig` writes; GKE writes v1 with interactiveMode:
//     IfAvailable spelled out. Either way IfAvailable resolves to
//     "interactive if os.Stdin is a terminal" — which it is, because kute
//     runs on a tty. The
//     plugin is then handed the real os.Stdin while Bubble Tea holds it in
//     raw mode: two readers on one descriptor, so keystrokes go missing, and
//     a plugin that prompts (expired SSO, gcloud re-auth, MFA) waits forever
//     for input the user cannot give it.
//   - stderr. client-go hands the plugin os.Stderr verbatim
//     (plugin/pkg/client/auth/exec/exec.go's `cmd.Stderr = a.stderr`) and
//     never reads it back, so anything the plugin prints lands on top of the
//     rendered frame — the same splatter silenceKlog exists to prevent, from
//     a source klog can't cover.
//
// Both are fixed here, in one place, because both are the same fact: kute
// owns the terminal, and the credential plugin has to be told so.

// credentialStdinMessage is what client-go appends to its own "standard input
// is unavailable" error for an interactiveMode: Always plugin. It names the
// recovery path, since kute cannot offer the plugin's own prompt: another
// shell, then 4a/4c's r.

// client's statement about itself, not the cluster's: setting it turns an
