// Package resources is the display catalog for Kubernetes resource kinds. Each
// kind has a Descriptor that knows its columns and how to project a raw API
// object into a display Row; a Registry maps kinds to descriptors and Groups
// bucket kinds for the Home explorer. This is the layer that makes adding a new
// resource type a single descriptor entry rather than a new screen.
//
// It depends on kube (for ResourceKind), the k8s API types it projects, and
// tui/components (Column/Cell — Theme-agnostic rendering primitives, see
// columns.go) — never on tui itself or any screen package, so the catalog
// stays a pure data/display concern with no Theme or Bubble Tea dependency.
