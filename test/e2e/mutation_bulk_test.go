// TestBulkDeleteMarkedSetCommits drives 20a end to end: filter, mark the
// filtered set with '*', and delete all of it behind one confirm.
//
// Bulk delete is the app's widest write — one keypress, N objects, no
// per-object confirmation — and every part of it that can go wrong only goes
// wrong against a real API server: the marked set is keyed by
// namespace+name while the deletes go out one request at a time, the list
// reloads from a watch rather than from the command's own result, and the
// cursor has to land somewhere sane when the rows under it stop existing.
//
// ConfigMaps rather than Pods on purpose: they delete immediately, with no
// grace period to wait out and no controller recreating them underneath the
// assertions.
